//to open cVim.rc just type :setting
following setting handy for cVim.
`
set noautofocus
let mapleader = ","
map <Leader>x :restore<Space>
`

Here setting I keep under `` quotation.
first one for input box specially for google. it help me to make inbox out of the focus when load. I can start writing after type f and respective auto generated key.

mapleader is , instead of \.
mapleader + x will show all closed tab in list (normally I can restore tab usign X. but  I want to restore specific url its really handy)
